            open collaboration. These include hypotheses, observations,
            connections, and reviews that all merit recognition. Like open
            source software that thrives on modular contributions, we&apos;re
            creating infrastructure where every insight, from any contributor,
            can find its place in the collective knowledge graph.

            New formats for publishing knowledge aren&apos;t enough - to make

            immediate value - greater recognition, serendipitous discoveries,
            and new collaborations.

            Small insights can become powerful building blocks when they&apos;re

            knowledge isn&apos;t locked up in platforms or fragmented formats.

            Aggregated at scale, modular research contributions translate into
            value far greater than the sum of their parts. We leverage
            decentralized networks like ATProto to maintain data accessibility
            while keeping ownership in researchers&apos; hands. We&apos;re
            creating a co-op model so researchers can help shape, guide, and
            benefit from the ecosystem their contributions sustain.
